## What is a Presentation

An oral presentation is typically prepared to 
summarize or disseminate work for a number of reasons. They can serve as a 
an accountability checkpoint for an organization funding research, or as a means
to share discovery with a variety of technical and non-technical audiences.


## Rules of the Presentation

- After you have been invited/accepted to give an oral presentation, outline and prepare your presentation.
- Know your audience and determine the style of presentation that suits them best
- Remember, this presentation is an advert for your work
- Try to spend around two minutes per slide
- Present the body of your talk with slides titled as summaries or guiding questions
- People will remember your figures, not your bullets (a generalization, but well founded)
- Never put something on a slide you do not throughouly, consistently, understand


## Writing the Presentation

- All grammatical and technical errors must be eliminated per the writing checklist
- Do not use bullets unless you are presenting an acual list
- Stick to simple backgrounds, one to two fonts, and use color as a secondary delimiter not a primary one
- Use a sans serif font for all text
- Use equations as a last resort (or sparingly if you are presenting a method), a plot/figure is much better at telling the whole story qualitatively
- Do not be afraid to put enlarged boxes over small text in images


## Presentation Review

- Make sure you allot adequate time for run-throughs (plural!), and revisions from the group
- When the document has been thoroughly checked, request a review from Prof. Huff and the group


## Using the Presentation Template

In the ARFC Github organization, there are several template repositories designed to aid the 
writing/creating process by giving you a starting place for formatting. To use the 
[report template](https://github.com/arfc/presentation-template), select the `Use this Template` 
option next to `Code`.
			
`Use this Template` will generate a repository on your GitHub account with copies of all the 
files in the original, including the Readme file. The Readme will serve as your point of 
reference for how to initialize the documents and some common errors that occur upon initial 
startup. Keep in mind that this template has a 
[CC-BY-4.0 License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/deed.ast). This license is 
the standard for written works and reports; however, there are cases where the use of material 
containing viral or copyleft licenses (such as GPL) can affect the type of license you can 
use in your report.
