I (Katy) am pleased to share that, as of May 13th, I've returned to Illinois, NPRE, and 
ARFC. After 3 years serving the U.S. Department of Energy, I am ready to get 
back to the important (and fun!) research and educational work here in 
Illinois. I am grateful to Dr. Madicken Munk for her work as Acting Director of 
ARFC during that time. We are extremely lucky to have had her expertise, 
leadership, and support.

Of course I'm especially grateful to the students, colleagues, and friends of 
ARFC who kept putting in such exceptional work in my absense. I'm lucky to be 
rejoining you. There's nowhere I would rather be.

While I intend for this 2024 summer to be a time of reflection and 
rejuvenation, I also intend to leverage this time to review the work that's 
been done in ARFC these last 3 years and to brainstorm new directions. Please 
bear with me as I revive the portions of my brain that may have atrophied 
during my time in Washington. 

As we look to the future, please note that we'll soon be recruiting new PhD 
students and at least one postdoctoral scholar.  Folks interested in joining 
the group should reach out directly to me by email at 
[kdhuff@illinois.edu](mailto:kdhuff@illinois.edu).
